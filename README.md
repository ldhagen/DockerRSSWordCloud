# 🚀 Deploy Your Enhanced RSS Word Counter

## 📁 File Updates Needed

Replace/create these files in your project directory:

### 1. **Replace your existing files:**
- `config.php` → Use the **Enhanced config.php**
- `index.php` → Use the **Enhanced index.php** 

### 2. **Add new files:**
- `analytics.php` → New analytics dashboard

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Your Files
```bash
# Stop the current container
docker-compose down

# Replace config.php and index.php with the enhanced versions
# Add analytics.php and wordcloud.php to your project directory

# Your directory should now look like:

# ├── wordcloud.php       ← NEW
# ├── feeds.json
# ├── stopwords.json
# ├── css/
# ├── data/
# ├── logs/
# └── cache/
```

### Step 2: Rebuild and Deploy
```bash
# Rebuild with new files
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start the enhanced version
docker-compose up -d

# Check if it's running
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 3: Test the Enhancements
```bash
# Access your enhanced application
open http://localhost:8080              # Main interface (enhanced)
open http://localhost:8080/analytics.php    # Analytics dashboard

```

docker-compose logs

# Check file permissions
ls -la *.php

# Try rebuilding
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

### If database features don't work:
```bash
# Check if database was created
ls -la data/

# Access container to debug
docker-compose exec rss-analyzer bash
cd data
ls -la

# Test database connection
sqlite3 analytics.db ".tables"
```

### If charts don't load:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure internet connection (loads Chart.js from CDN)

1. **Automated collection** (cron jobs)
2. **Email reports** 
3. **API endpoints**
