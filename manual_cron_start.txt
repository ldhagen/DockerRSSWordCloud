Cron is not running. That's the root problem. The startup script should start it, but it's not working.
Check if the startup script exists and what it contains:
bash
docker
exec-it
rss-word-counter
cat
/usr/local/bin/start-services.sh
Then check what command the container is actually running:
bash
docker
exec-it
rss-word-counter
ps
aux
The issue is likely that the CMD in the Dockerfile isn't executing, or the startup script is failing silently. Let's start cron manually for now:
bash
docker
exec-it
rss-word-counter
service cron
start
docker
exec-it
rss-word-counter
ps aux
grep
cron
Once cron is running, check if the jobs execute properly:
bash
docker
exec-it
rss-word-counter
tail
-f
/var/www/html/logs/cron.log
The fundamental problem is that your container isn't running the startup script that should launch both cron and Apache. We need to figure out why. Check the Docker logs:
bash
docker
logs
rss-word-counter
head -20
This should show what happened when the container started.
